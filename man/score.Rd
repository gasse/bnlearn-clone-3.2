\title{ Score of the Bayesian network }
\description{

  Compute the score of the Bayesian network.

}
\usage{
score(x, data, type = NULL, ..., debug = FALSE)

\method{logLik}{bn}(object, data, ...)
\method{AIC}{bn}(object, data, ..., k = 1)
\method{BIC}{bn}(object, data, ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x, object}{an object of class \code{bn}.}
  \item{data}{a data frame containing the data the Bayesian network
       was learned from.}
  \item{type}{a character string, the label of a network score.
      If none is specified, the default score is the \emph{Bayesian
      Information Criterion} for both discrete and continuous data
      sets. See \code{\link{bnlearn-package}} for details.}
  \item{debug}{a boolean value. If \code{TRUE} a lot of debugging output
       is printed; otherwise the function is completely silent.}
  \item{\dots}{extra arguments from the generic method (for the \code{AIC}
       and \code{logLik} functions, currently ignored) or additional
       tuning parameters (for the \code{score} function).}
  \item{k}{a numeric value, the penalty per parameter to be used; the
       default \code{k = 1} gives the expression used to compute the
       AIC in the context of scoring Bayesian networks.}
}
\details{

  Additional parameters of the \code{score} function:

  \itemize{

    \item \code{iss}: the imaginary sample size, used by the Bayesian
        Dirichlet equivalent score (both the \code{bde} and \code{mbde})
        and the Bayesian Gaussian posterior density. It is also known as
        \dQuote{equivalent sample size}. The default value is equal to
        \code{10} for both the \code{bde}/\code{mbde} scores and \code{bge}.

    \item \code{exp}: a list of indexes of experimental observations (those
        that have been artificially manipulated). Each element of the list
        must be named after one of the nodes, and must contain a numeric
        vector with indexes of the observations whose value has been
        manipulated for that node.

    \item \code{k}: the penalty per parameter to be used by the AIC and
        BIC scores. The default value is \code{1} for AIC and
        \code{log(nrow(data))/2} for BIC.

    \item \code{phi}: the prior phi matrix formula to use in the
        Bayesian Gaussian equivalent (\code{bge}) score. Possible
        values are \code{heckerman} (default) and \code{bottcher}
        (the one used by default in the \pkg{deal} package.)

\examples{
data(learning.test)
res = set.arc(gs(learning.test), "A", "B")
score(res, learning.test, type = "bde")
# [1] -23967.65
## let's see score equivalence in action!
res2 = set.arc(gs(learning.test), "B", "A")
score(res2, learning.test, type = "bde")
# [1] -23967.65

## k2 score on the other hand is not score equivalent.
score(res, learning.test, type = "k2")
# [1] -23958.70
score(res2, learning.test, type = "k2")
# [1] -23957.68

## equivalent to logLik(res, learning.test)
score(res, learning.test, type = "loglik")
# [1] -23832.13

## equivalent to AIC(res, learning.test)
score(res, learning.test, type = "aic")
